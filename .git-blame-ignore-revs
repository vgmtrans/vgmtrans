# This file contains a list of Git commit hashes that should be hidden from the
# regular Git history. Typically, this includes commits involving mass auto-formatting
# or other normalizations. Commit hashes *must* use the full 40-character notation.
# To apply the ignore list in your local Git client, you must run:
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This file is automatically used by GitHub.com's blame view.
