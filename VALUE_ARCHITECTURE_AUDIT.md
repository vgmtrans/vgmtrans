# Value architecture simplification audit

Starting revision: `79f812a54` (`core-rewrite-refactor`).

The goal is to make format implementations and the shared architecture easier
to understand, while retaining SequenceVM, conversion behavior, source
inspection, and the separation between source formats and export targets.
Reductions should remove responsibilities or redundant representations, not
compress code or hide format behavior behind a new framework.

## Baseline and verification

- The value formats contain 71,728 lines across their source and header files.
- The existing `vgmtrans-value-core-tests` suite passes at the starting revision.
- The legacy/value parity harness self-test passes at the starting revision.
- No real-file parity corpus is configured in `cmake-build-debug`, and no game
  corpus was found in the workspace. Synthetic tests cannot establish parity
  for every game; preserve that distinction when assessing these changes.
- The initial include audit found no MIDI/SF2/DLS exporter or legacy-core
  includes in value formats, sequence code, or synth code.
- After the first two reductions, the value core suite, standalone Square PS2
  and Sony PS2 suites, and parity self-test all pass (4 CTest targets). The
  build completes without compiler warnings.

## Changes

### Remove unused decoded operand classifications

Ordinary command operands carried roles such as `Duration`, `Pitch`, `Level`,
`NoteKey`, and `Count`. No production consumer used these classifications.
They were transient, discarded after decoding, and did not affect source-map
presentation. Names and display settings already described these values.

Remove those enum cases and their arguments throughout the formats. Keep roles
used by source links, source-channel attribution, and AKAO instrument discovery.
For example, `event.u8("duration", SemanticOperandRole::Duration)` becomes
`event.u8("duration")`; an encoded jump target still declares `JumpTarget`.
The equal-valued-operand regression test still verifies that a jump does not
turn an unrelated numeric operand into a source link.

### Read SNES samples directly from instrument records

Many format-local helpers copied SRCNs into vectors, sometimes sorted and
deduplicated them, and passed them to a catalog reader that did that work again.
The shared reader now accepts a record range and a projection such as
`&Patch::srcn`. Formats retain their own instrument validation and sample
selection rules. The existing catalog implementation continues to determine
sample order, validate streams, and preserve directory ranges.

Remove the repeated collectors and redundant AKAO/Konami sample-reader wrapper
APIs. A synthetic catalog test covers unordered records, duplicate SRCNs,
invalid streams, and exact directory/payload ranges.

## Further investigation

- Compiler cursor: duplicated adapters for emitting ordinary performance events;
  control-flow helpers whose names imply distinctions their implementations do
  not make.
- Runtime: repeated per-track initialization flags and `beforeCommand` guards;
  distinguish track startup from song-wide and per-command behavior before
  centralizing it.
- Record reader: repeated fixed-width read/annotation logic; preserve the
  different failure policies of sequential and positioned reads.
- Synth construction and source maps: repeated range accumulation and envelope
  projection; preserve ownership, authoritative explicit ranges, and aliases.
- VM scheduling, collection binding, export lowering, and instrument variants:
  continue looking for redundant state and representations. Avoid speculative
  exporter interfaces for formats the application does not yet support.
