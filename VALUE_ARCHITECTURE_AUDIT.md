# Value architecture simplification audit

Starting revision: `79f812a54` (`core-rewrite-refactor`).

The goal is to make format implementations and the shared architecture easier
to understand, while retaining SequenceVM, conversion behavior, source
inspection, and the separation between source formats and export targets.
Reductions should remove responsibilities or redundant representations, not
compress code or hide format behavior behind a new framework.

## Baseline and verification

- The value formats contain 71,728 lines across their source and header files.
- The existing `vgmtrans-value-core-tests` suite passes at the starting revision.
- The legacy/value parity harness self-test passes at the starting revision.
- No real-file parity corpus is configured in `cmake-build-debug`, and no game
  corpus was found in the workspace. Synthetic tests cannot establish parity
  for every game; preserve that distinction when assessing these changes.
- The initial include audit found no MIDI/SF2/DLS exporter or legacy-core
  includes in value formats, sequence code, or synth code.
- After the first two reductions, the value core suite, standalone Square PS2
  and Sony PS2 suites, and parity self-test all pass (4 CTest targets). The
  build completes without compiler warnings.

## Changes

### Remove unused decoded operand classifications

Ordinary command operands carried roles such as `Duration`, `Pitch`, `Level`,
`NoteKey`, and `Count`. No production consumer used these classifications.
They were transient, discarded after decoding, and did not affect source-map
presentation. Names and display settings already described these values.

Remove those enum cases and their arguments throughout the formats. Keep roles
used by source links, source-channel attribution, and AKAO instrument discovery.
For example, `event.u8("duration", SemanticOperandRole::Duration)` becomes
`event.u8("duration")`; an encoded jump target still declares `JumpTarget`.
The equal-valued-operand regression test still verifies that a jump does not
turn an unrelated numeric operand into a source link.

### Read SNES samples directly from instrument records

Many format-local helpers copied SRCNs into vectors, sometimes sorted and
deduplicated them, and passed them to a catalog reader that did that work again.
The shared reader now accepts a record range and a projection such as
`&Patch::srcn`. Formats retain their own instrument validation and sample
selection rules. The existing catalog implementation continues to determine
sample order, validate streams, and preserve directory ranges.

Remove the repeated collectors and redundant AKAO/Konami sample-reader wrapper
APIs. A synthetic catalog test covers unordered records, duplicate SRCNs,
invalid streams, and exact directory/payload ranges.

### Share fixed-width record reads

The sixteen sequential and positioned integer readers repeated bounds checks,
cursor updates, numeric conversion, source ranges, and field annotation. Two
private helpers now own that work. Their public named readers are unchanged,
and the helpers remain implemented in the `.cpp` file.

Keep separate bounds policies: sequential reads stop after the first failure;
positioned reads can recover other complete fields from a damaged record.
Variable-length, 24-bit, and raw-byte reads retain their specific behavior.
Tests cover all eight integer readers in both access modes, including signed
values, endian order, annotations, partial consumption, and diagnostic count.
The same four CTest targets pass after this change, with no compiler warnings.

### Accumulate source ranges in one place

`SourceRange::include` now owns the common covering-range operation. It keeps
the first source, ignores invalid and foreign ranges, and includes zero-length
anchors. Source maps, inspection, sequence extents, AKAO banks, and synth
builders use the same operation instead of maintaining local min/max loops.

Synth builders no longer wrap already-nullable ranges in `optional`, or store
separate observed copies of instrument and region ranges. Explicit ranges
remain authoritative. The range regression test covers disjoint records,
anchors, and source boundaries; the existing builder and inspection tests
cover their ownership policies. Core, Square PS2, Sony PS2, UI, and parity
self-tests all pass (5 CTest targets), with no compiler warnings.

### Keep compiled operations beside their public methods

Remove the second layer of private templates behind ordinary compiler-cursor
operations. Output, state updates, waits, and counted repeats now construct
their small command bodies directly. Scalar output parameters use the
emitter's concrete types instead of instantiating templates just to convert
them later. Source instrument identities own their strings when compiled.

This removes 88 production lines and 23 private helper names without adding an
abstraction. Existing tests cover command ordering, state updates, repeats,
flow conflicts, and source-free execution. An additional lifetime test checks
temporary instrument domains, envelope policy, and absent versus declared
level quantization. The same five CTest targets pass without compiler warnings.

### Use one arithmetic path for sequence motion

Timed motion now shares its startup and completion rules whether its step is
computed or supplied by the driver. Fixed-point automation normalizes its
current raw value and delegates step calculation to that same implementation;
it no longer computes the step a second time and changes the plan's mode.
Remove unused getters and callback overloads inherited from legacy helpers.

Regression tests cover delay boundaries, integer truncation, exact final
targets, custom steps, zero-length motion, and negative rounding on retarget.
A separate generated comparison against the previous header checked 7,808,386
integer, floating-point, and fixed-point transitions under AddressSanitizer
and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer with no differences or sanitizer findings.
All five CTest targets pass, with no compiler warnings. This removes 54
production lines while keeping the existing format-facing motion plans.

### Remove duplicate VM loop and analysis paths

Loop handling already changes the executor's current command. Remove the
extra action enum and result wrapper that repeated whether that command still
exists. Requested loop repeats and temporary replays while coordinating the
sequence endpoint now share their setup. Repeat snapshots use their existing
map value directly instead of a one-field wrapper with a forwarding comparison.

Analysis and prepass rendering use one silent-pass path. Tests verify that
analysis executes once both with and without a prepass hook, and invokes that
hook exactly once when present. Existing VM tests cover finite repeats,
inferred and declared loops, loop counts, synchronized cutoffs, section
playlists, and sustained notes. All 17 configured CTest targets have now been
rebuilt and pass, including the additional standalone format suites.

## Further investigation

- Compiler cursor: duplicated adapters for emitting ordinary performance events;
  control-flow helpers whose names imply distinctions their implementations do
  not make.
- Runtime: repeated per-track initialization flags and `beforeCommand` guards;
  distinguish track startup from song-wide and per-command behavior before
  centralizing it.
- Synth construction and source maps: repeated range accumulation and envelope
  projection; preserve ownership, authoritative explicit ranges, and aliases.
- VM scheduling, collection binding, export lowering, and instrument variants:
  continue looking for redundant state and representations. Avoid speculative
  exporter interfaces for formats the application does not yet support.
