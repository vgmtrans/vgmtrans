## Usage

### Loading Files
Load files by dragging them into the application window or by using the `File` => `Open` menu action. The program will scan a
file for contained music files, which when found will appear under the "Detected Music Files" panel. 

VGMTrans is able to 
unpack portable sound format files (PSF) and derivatives (PSF2, SSF, etc). SNES formats generally must be loaded from SPC or RSN files. 
Arcade formats are loaded via mame rom set zip files, which are catalogued in `mame_roms.xml`.

### Detected Music Files
Right-clicking a file listed in the Detected Music Files panel will bring up a menu of conversion options. Double-clicking 
a detected file will open it in the Hex View. 

### Collections
For some formats, when files representing musical sequences, instruments, and samples are all loaded, VGMTrans may
associate these files together into a Collection. Collections are listed in the Collections panel at the bottom of the
main window. Double-clicking a collection or selecting one and pressing the space bar or clicking the green Play button 
will attempt to play back the sequence using its associated instrument data.

Right-clicking a collection will bring up a menu with conversion options.

### Manual Collection Creation (advanced)
Sometimes VGMTrans cannot properly associate detected files into Collections. In this event, the "Create collection manually" 
button at the bottom of the Collection panel can be used. This buttons open a dialog that allows detected files
to be selected to form a new Collection.


### Hex View
Double-clicking a detected file opens an interactive Hex View. The Hex View provides a visual
breakdown of a file's structure, with each element color-coded and annotated upon selection. 
The accompanying File Structure panel to the right of the Hex View provides a hierarchical list of all the elements 
within the file. Clicking an element, either in the Hex View or the File Structure panel, highlights it and
displays more information about the element in the status bar at the bottom of the main window. When enabled, the "Show Details"
toggle button in the top right corner of the File Structure panel will display details for each element directly
in the File Structure panel.
