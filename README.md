## Usage

#### *Loading Files*
Load files by dragging them into the application window or by choosing `Scan File` from the File menu. The program will scan a
file for contained music files, which when found will appear under the "Detected Music Files" panel.

VGMTrans is able to 
unpack portable sound format files (`psf`) and related formats (`psf2`, `ssf`, etc). SNES formats generally must be loaded 
from `spc` or `rsn` files. Arcade formats are loaded via mame rom set `zip` files, which are catalogued in `mame_roms.json`.

#### *Scanned Files*

The Scanned Files panel lists all files that have been scanned by VGMTrans which yielded detected files.
A scanned file can be removed by selecting it and pressing `Delete` or `Backspace`, or by selecting `Remove` from the File menu or right-click context menu.
When removed, all detected files contained in the scanned file will also be removed.

#### *Detected Music Files*
Selecting files enables actions in the Convert menu and right-click context menu. Double-clicking
a detected file will open it in an Analysis View. Detected Files can be removed by pressing `Delete` or `Backspace`, or by selecting `Remove` from the File menu or right-click context menu.

#### *Collections*
For some formats, when files representing musical sequences, instruments, and samples are all loaded, VGMTrans may
associate these files together into a Collection. Collections are listed in the Collections panel at the bottom of the
main window. Double-clicking a collection or selecting one and pressing `Space Bar`, choosing `Play / Pause` from the Preview menu, or clicking the green Play button
will attempt to play back the sequence using its associated instrument data.

Conversion commands are available from the Convert menu or by right-clicking a collection.

#### *Manual Collection Creation (advanced)*
Sometimes VGMTrans cannot properly group detected files into Collections. In this event, the `Create collection manually` 
button at the bottom of the Collection panel can be used. The button opens a dialog to select a set of detected files for
which to create a new Collection.


#### *Analysis View*
Double-clicking a detected file opens an interactive Analysis View. The Analysis View provides a visual
breakdown of a file's structure as color-coded hexadecimal data.
The accompanying File Structure panel on the right of the view provides a hierarchical list of all the elements
within the file. Clicking an element, either in the Analysis View or the File Structure panel, highlights it and
displays more information about the element in the status bar at the bottom of the main window. When enabled, the "Show Details"
toggle button in the top right corner of the File Structure panel will display details for each element directly
in the File Structure panel.

#### *Batch Conversion*

To convert files in batch, select multiple files of the same type (denoted by icon) in the Detected Music Files panel,
then use the Convert menu or right-click the selection and choose a conversion action. Similarly, Collections can be converted in batch by
selecting multiple.
