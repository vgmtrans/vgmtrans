## Usage

To load a file, drag and drop the file into the application window.  The program will scan any file for contained music files. It knows how to unpack psf, psf2 and certain zipped mame rom sets as specified in the mame_roms.xml file.  For example, drag on an NDS rom file and it will detect SDAT files and their contents.

Once loaded, double-clicking a file listed under "Detected Music Files" will bring up a color-coded hexadecimal display of the file with a break-down of each format element.  Click the hexadecimal to highlight an element and see more information.  Right click a detected file to bring up save options.  To remove files from the "Detected Music Files" or "Scanned Files" list, highlight the files and press the delete key.

The "Collections" window displays file groupings that the software was able to infer.  A sequence file will be paired with one or more instrument sets and/or sample collections. A collection can be played by double-clicking it or by highlighting it and pressing the play button or spacebar.
